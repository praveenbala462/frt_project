### Project Title: Travel With Travelo
### Problem Statement/Opportunity:
 <p>   Nowadays people face a lot of issues while selecting a destination place while travelling they even face issues while booking hotels while travelling in new places so in order to solve this problem I have created a website named "Travelo" where people can select particular destination place of their interest and this website will also provide users the details of hotels near their destiny place so they should not face any issue while travelling. This website will help the travelers in various way and hence will reduce their effort too keeping all these things in my mind I have created "Travelo".</p>

### Project Description:
 <p>   I have created a website named "Travelo" which will help the users or travelers to travel easily to their destiny place without any issue and it will reduce many efforts. I have added 5 sections that is Home, About Us, Services, Gallery and Contact. This website will contain all the information along with pictures of the selected destination place so it will be easy for the person to select the place and travel according to his/her wish. It will contain all the information of the nearby hotels of the destination place with pictures of the hotels, cost of stay, reviews etc., Hence Travelo will help lot of people to choose their destination place without any hesitation.</p>
